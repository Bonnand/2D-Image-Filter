# 2D Image Filter Project on FPGA Target

## Project Description
This project implements 2D image filters on an FPGA target, processing images in `.dat` format with a resolution of 128x128 pixels. The included filters allow for different transformations:

- **Sobel**: Edge detection
- **Average**: Image blurring
- **Laplace**: Edge enhancement

## Project Structure

- **`doc/`**: Contains the project documentation, including explanations of the programs, descriptions of simulations, and results.
- **`tools/`**: Contains various tools and scripts for manipulating and testing images, applying filters, and visualizing results.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bonnand/2D-Image-Filter.git
cd 2D-Image-Filter
